# 3Dverkstan shield â€” modified A4

Based on the 3Dverk design, and functionally the same, this is a smaller model with a shield image designed for cutting on a Cricut.

* The modified visor 3D model (modified for smaller 3D printers): https://www.youmagine.com/designs/frame-for-oh-paper-visor-swedish-punch-hole-59-21
* The original 3Dverkstan model: https://3dverkstan.se/protective-visor/
* The shield file was modified by me (Tim Murtaugh github.com/murtaugh) to fit the visor and for automatic cutting on a Cricut.
